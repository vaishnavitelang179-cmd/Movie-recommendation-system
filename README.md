Movie Recommendation System

A lightweight, content-based movie recommendation system built with Python, Streamlit, and scikit-learn. The app suggests movies similar to a selected title using metadata such as genres, keywords, cast, crew, and plot summaries. Poster images are fetched in real time using the TMDb API.
